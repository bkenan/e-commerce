# E-commerce application

This is a small e-commerce application that allows sellers to place their auctions and buyers to bid for the listings.
The app has the following functionalities: Register, login, creating listings, add/remove listings into/from watchlists and even writing comments.

## Technologies used

The backend was completely built in Django and I used SQL for the database.

## How to run:


python manage.py runserver
